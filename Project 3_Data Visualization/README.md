# LOAN FROM PROPSER DATA ANALYSIS
## by SANGOTADE IDOWU


## Dataset

> This project is divided into two major parts. In the first part, you will conduct an exploratory data analysis on a dataset Ford GoBike System Data. I will use Python libraries to explore the dataset’s variables and understand the data’s structure, oddities, patterns and relationships. The analysis in this part should be structured, going from simple univariate relationships up through multivariate relationships.

> In the second part, I will take my main findings from my exploration and convey them to others through an explanatory analysis. To this end, I will create a slide deck that leverages polished, explanatory visualizations to communicate my results.


## Summary of Findings

> In the exploration, I found that the borrower APR is negatively correlated with original loan amount. At different size of the loan amount, the APR has a large range, but the range of APR decrease with the increase of loan amount. The borrower APR also decreases with the increasingly better rating. Borrowers with the best Prosper ratings have the lowest APR. Interestingly, the relationship between borrower APR and loan amount turns from negative to slightly positive when the Prosper ratings at ratings of A and better. 

> Further to the above, I found that the loan amount is positively correlated with the stated monthly income, it makes sense since borrowers with more monthly income can request to loan more money. The loan amount is also increased with the increase of loan term. I also found that borrowers with better ratings have larger monthly income and loan amount. Employed, self-employed and full time borrowers have more monthly income and loan amount than part-time, retired and not employed borrowers.Also , there are more 5 year loans on B and C ratings. There is only 3 year loans for HR rating borrowers.

## Key Insights for Presentation

> For the presentation, my main focus was on loan amount and proper rating. I started by showing the distribution of borrower APR and loan amount variable. Then, I showed the relationship between Borrowers APR vs. loan amount, as well as Borrowers APR vs prosper rating.
